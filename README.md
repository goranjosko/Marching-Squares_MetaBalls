# Marching-Squares_MetaBalls
Optimized marching squares algorithm used to draws metaballs in p5.js processing. 


Usually, the **marching squares** algorithm goes through the grid, in order, line by line, and this can be **terribly slow** in scripts like this one. 
This optimized version finds only the edges of the spheres and then draws the metaballs shapes, It is incomparably faster.

To start animation, the p5.js processing library is necessary, which can be downloaded for free from https://p5js.org/download/
**p5.min.js should be added to the same directory**
